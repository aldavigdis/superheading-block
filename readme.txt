Add accessible headings for the WordPress Block Editor with superheadings and subheadings.

== Description ==

If you want to get things right, headings can get tricky when you have both subheadings and an overheading above the main heading.

Current web standards recommend the use of the `<hgroup>` element but this block demonstrates the use of plain-and-simple heading elements, which maintains the heading hierarchy and ensures accessibility, while also facilitating typographical hierarchy.
